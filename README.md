# Blog Frontend

This repo is specifically for the client side of the Blog-API. The rest of the project consists of REST API only backend as well as a frontend CMS. Separate websites for the API and blog CMS were created and are linked below.

## About the Project

This full stack web app was part of the self-taught education of The Odin Project NodeJS Curriculum.

Creating a blog from the ground up was an opportunity to further develop REST API skills and to demonstrate the power and flexibility of separating backend code from frontend code.
